Vendor Inventory Management System Using Django, PostgreSQL and Javascript
-------------------------

*   üß†¬† One of the key businesses for financial services consultancies is to assist companies to identify and
        select the appropriate technology (applications and infrastructure) for their business needs. To do this
        effectively, the consultancy must have functional and technical knowledge about the different solutions
        that are available in the market. This insight is obtained via vendor demonstrations, online
        investigations, training courses, and, of course, experience selecting and implementing the application
        for customers. The information gained is often stored in multiple document libraries and Excel
        spreadsheets. This method makes it difficult to review, keep up to date, aggregate and analyze the
        different vendor products efficiently. It also often results in key person risk where only a few people
        know the details of the different possible solutions.
        What is required is the ability to enter information into a centralised data repository that stores the key
        information for each vendor and their applications. This information must be easy to maintain, search
        for, and evaluate solution options based on the customer‚Äôs specific needs. Think Amazon for financial
        services vendors.
        A key component for the success of this application is how easy it is to understand and use. The user
        interface must be simple to use both from a data entry and an information discovery perspective


  Current Challenges:

    
        1. Lack of visibility + lack of relevant information makes it difficult to determine the
        appropriateness of potential solutions easily and quickly for clients = Lost Revenue.

        2. Unable to deliver timely, relevant, and insightful solution ideas for clients due to the amount of
        manual work required to gather and organise information = Lost Opportunities

        3. Vendor application knowledge is siloed/manual with information/data captured and stored in
        various places using various methods, making it more cumbersome to identify, analyse, and
        compare different solution opportunities for clients = Lost time

Fuctionality:

        A data repository that stores and links together both structured and unstructured data for a
        vendor and their products. This type of information will be both in a structured and an
        unstructured format (e.g., PDF documents, etc.)

        
        A user-friendly interface that allows authorized users to enter, maintain and view the vendor
        and their associated product(s) data. What a user can do in the system depends on their
        assigned access rights.

        
        User profile setup and maintenance with the ability to specify which type of functionality they
        can do in the system (e.g., set up a new system record, maintain a system record, view
        information, etc.).

        
        Searching capabilities based on multiple user-selected criteria. Display the search results and be
        able to drill down into a specific result to get more details about the vendor and/or application.
        
        
        Be able to store and select a link to a vendor‚Äôs website.
        
        
        Be able to select and open a PDF document that is attached to a specific vendor and/or their
        product(s) from within the system so that it can be viewed online.
        
        
        Create an on-line report that contains details of the selected system or systems. This report
        should be in PDF format and be able to be saved and/or printed. Optionally, create an Excel
        spreadsheet with the data.
        
        
        Identify when a new vendor entry is added to the system and when an existing vendor entry is
        updated. This can be done using a screen available in the system or by sending an email to users
        who indicate that they wish to receive one.
        
        
        Indicate when the information for a vendor should be reviewed based on the last review date
        entered. This can be done using a screen available in the system. The System Administrator
        should be able to specify the number of days from the current date after which the entry should
        be reviewed.
        
        
        If a specific vendor or product is selected, identify potentially similar applications (e.g., like the,
        ‚ÄúFrequently bought together‚Äù, functionality in Amazon.
        
        
        Allow users to leave comments for, and rate out of 5 stars, the vendor and/or specific
        application. Be able to show the comments.
