Vendor Inventory Management System Using Django, PostgreSQL and Javascript
-------------------------

*   üß†¬† One of the key businesses for financial services consultancies is to assist companies to identify and
        select the appropriate technology (applications and infrastructure) for their business needs. To do this
        effectively, the consultancy must have functional and technical knowledge about the different solutions
        that are available in the market. This insight is obtained via vendor demonstrations, online
        investigations, training courses, and, of course, experience selecting and implementing the application
        for customers. The information gained is often stored in multiple document libraries and Excel
        spreadsheets. This method makes it difficult to review, keep up to date, aggregate and analyze the
        different vendor products efficiently. It also often results in key person risk where only a few people
        know the details of the different possible solutions.
        What is required is the ability to enter information into a centralised data repository that stores the key
        information for each vendor and their applications. This information must be easy to maintain, search
        for, and evaluate solution options based on the customer‚Äôs specific needs. Think Amazon for financial
        services vendors.
        A key component for the success of this application is how easy it is to understand and use. The user
        interface must be simple to use both from a data entry and an information discovery perspective

    Current Challenges
        1. Lack of visibility + lack of relevant information makes it difficult to determine the
        appropriateness of potential solutions easily and quickly for clients = Lost Revenue.
<b></b>
        2. Unable to deliver timely, relevant, and insightful solution ideas for clients due to the amount of
        manual work required to gather and organise information = Lost Opportunities
<b></b>
        3. Vendor application knowledge is siloed/manual with information/data captured and stored in
        various places using various methods, making it more cumbersome to identify, analyse, and
        compare different solution opportunities for clients = Lost time
